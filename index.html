        <p>Hello! My name is Christian Sandoya, I am from Lima, Peru, and I am 18 years old. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ. I have three siblings, two brothers and one sister. And I really like to play soccer and listen to music.
          I am thrilled to share with you the latest developments in my spiritual journey. Recently, I completed my studies at the seminary and had the honor of graduating on January 7, 2024. Subsequently, on February 21 of the same year, I received my mission call, which I am eagerly looking forward to beginning on May 6th. Currently, I am serving as the secretary of the elders' quorum presidency of the Canta Callao ward of the Naranjal stake, which has been an enriching and fulfilling experience.
          In terms of academics, I am proud to say that I graduated from school with honors, and I have taken various community management and real estate courses. I have also received the EnglishConnect3 and Pathway Worldwide certificates, which have helped me further my education. I am currently pursuing my studies in the software development baccalaureate program at the BYU-Idaho online program, which I find to be an incredibly rewarding experience.
          As for my career, I am currently working as a real estate broker, following in the footsteps of my father. I have been able to use my knowledge and expertise in this field to help people find their dream homes and make wise investments. Additionally, in my free time, I enjoy sharing my passion for music by teaching piano and musical language classes. It brings me great joy to see my students grow and develop their skills in this beautiful art form.
